# GroupSplit [HackTheU 2018](https://hacktheu.com)

This year's themes are fin-tech, entrepreneurship, and community. This project is a progressive web app that allows users to easily split and track expenses among groups of friends, roommates, etc.

## Competition

There are some other products out there that are somewhat similar to this. But GroupSplit will be better than all of 'em.
These products include:

- [Splitwise](https://www.splitwise.com/)
- [Splittr](https://www.splittr.io/)
- [Billr](http://billr.me/)
- [Divvy](https://getdivvy.com/)
- [Venmo](https://venmo.com/)
